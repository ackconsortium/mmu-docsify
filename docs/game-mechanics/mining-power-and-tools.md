# Mining Power and Tools <!-- {docsify-ignore-all} -->

In MMU, each NFT tool and PFP has a base mining power of 0.005. Adding a PFP increases mining power by 0.001. 
** You need at least 1 PFP Alien and 1 Tool to be able to mine and up to 1 Alien and 3 Tools. **\
Tools gain extra mining power if the terrain matches the tool:

* Common: +0.01
* Rare: +0.012
* Epic: +0.014
* Mythic: +0.018

The reward amount is calculated as :

```
reward = mining_power * resource_amount_on_land
```

Different tools have varying efficiencies on different land types, so strategic use is crucial for maximizing rewards.

Tools and PFP Aliens have a **24-hour cooldown** period


### **Phase 2 Update (TBD)**:&#x20;

Tool durability will be introduced, impacting how long tools can be used before needing repair or replacement. \
Additionally, the MarsTrader artisticart collection will provide bonuses to tools, such as increased mining power and reduced cooldown times. \
Buildings will also play a more significant role.
